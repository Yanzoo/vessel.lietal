ENGLISH
  Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, 
  so everyone in the village called her <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>.<br />
  One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother 
  if she could go to visit her grandmother 
  as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.<br />
  "That's a good idea", her mother said.
  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood
  to take to her grandmother. When the basket was ready, 
  the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.<br />
  "Remember, go straight to Grandma's house", her mother cautioned. 
  "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!"
  "The woods are dangerous."
